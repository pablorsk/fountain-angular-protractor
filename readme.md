# Protractor with angularjs generated via [generator-fountain-webapp](https://github.com/FountainJS/generator-fountain-webapp)

```bash
gulp protractor
```

If you see another example, check test/index.spec.another.js.

## Development mode

Also, if you need test actual app on development mode, you need:

- Change url on index.spec.js
- Start server before with `gulp serve`
- `gulp protractor`
